Description: Under- and over-dispersed binary data are modeled using an extended Poisson 
 process model (EPPM) appropriate for binary data. A feature of the model is that the 
 under-dispersion relative to the binomial distribution only needs to be greater than
 zero, but the over-dispersion is  restricted compared to other distributional models  
 such as the beta and correlated binomials. Because of this, the examples focus on 
 under-dispersed data and how, in combination with the beta or correlated distributions,
 flexible models can be fitted to data displaying both under- and over-dispersion. Using
 Generalized Linear Model (GLM)  terminology, the functions utilize linear predictors for
 the probability of success and scale-factor with various link functions for p, and log 
 link for scale-factor, to fit a variety of models relevant to areas such as bioassay.
